### JavaScript for Web Development

This repository contains JavaScript concepts, examples, and practice code for learning Web Development.  
It covers fundamentals to intermediate-level topics required for frontend development.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)
Used to store data values in JavaScript.  
- `var` → function-scoped (older way)  
- `let` → block-scoped, can be updated  
- `const` → block-scoped, cannot be reassigned  

---

### 🔹 Data Types
Define the type of value stored in a variable.  
Includes:
- Primitive types (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, BigInt, Symbol)
- Non-primitive types (Objects, Arrays, Functions)

---

### 🔹 Operators
Used to perform operations on values and variables.  
Includes arithmetic (`+`, `-`), comparison (`==`, `===`), logical (`&&`, `||`), assignment (`+=`, `-=`), and more.

---

### 🔹 Functions (All Types)
Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.  
Includes function declarations, function expressions, arrow functions, callbacks, async functions, etc.

---

### 🔹 Arrays & Array Methods
Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.  
Common methods include `push()`, `pop()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()` for data manipulation.

---

### 🔹 Objects
Objects store data in key-value pairs.  
They are used to represent real-world entities and structured data.

---

### 🔹 Loops (`for`, `while`, `forEach`)
Used to execute a block of code repeatedly.  
Helpful for iterating over arrays and performing repeated tasks.

---

### 🔹 Conditional Statements (`if-else`, `switch`)
Used to make decisions in code based on conditions.

---
### TO BE DONEEEEE
### 🔹 DOM Manipulation (To Be Done)
DOM (Document Object Model) allows JavaScript to interact with HTML elements.  
Used to change content, styles, structure, and respond to user actions.

---

### 🔹 Events
Used to handle user interactions such as clicks, typing, form submission, etc.

---

### 🔹 ES6 Features
Modern JavaScript features like:
- Arrow Functions  
- Spread & Rest Operators  
- Destructuring  
- Template Literals  
- Modules  

---

### 🔹 Async JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await)
Used to handle asynchronous operations like API calls, timers, and data fetching without blocking execution.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals  
- Support CSE-11 coursework  
- Prepare for frontend development  
- Build a base for React and modern frameworks
